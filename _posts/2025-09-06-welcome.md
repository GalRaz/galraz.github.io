Welcome to this space where I'll be sharing thoughts, observations, and reflections from my current chapter working on the Gelephu Mindfulness City project in Bhutan, alongside my role as a Visiting Researcher at the Henkaku Center in Japan.

After years in academia—most recently as a PhD student at MIT studying the computational mechanisms of visual attention in infants—I've found myself in a fascinating transition period. The shift from academic research to applied project management has offered unexpected insights into how knowledge translates (or doesn't translate) from theory to practice.

Living and working between Bhutan and Japan while carrying my own cultural background has created a rich layering of perspectives that I'm still processing. There's something profound about experiencing how different cultural frameworks approach similar challenges, and how one's own assumptions become visible only through contrast.

In this blog, I'll be exploring questions that have emerged from this intersection: How do we make decisions when the stakes are real rather than theoretical? What's the difference between having helpful knowledge and being genuinely useful? How do operational frameworks compare to learning as you go? 

I'm particularly interested in the dynamics of knowledge sharing—the academic tendency to perfect ideas in isolation versus the possibility of thinking out loud and inviting collaboration throughout the process. There's also the question of how hierarchical structures actually function in practice, beyond our emotional reactions to them.

Some posts will dive into what I'm calling "spiritual materialism"—the ways our pursuit of meaning can become another form of acquisition. Others will explore the challenge of separating inputs from outputs, a surprisingly fundamental issue that shows up everywhere from policy design to personal decision-making.

This isn't meant to be a polished collection of final thoughts, but rather a space for working through ideas that are still forming. If you're interested in the messy process of translating between worlds—academic and practical, Western and Eastern, individual and institutional—I hope you'll find something useful here.

More to come as these ideas develop.
