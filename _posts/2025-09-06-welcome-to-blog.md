Welcome to my new blog section! 

I've decided to start sharing more regular insights, reflections, and thoughts about my work in Bhutan, research, and the interesting intersections between technology, mindfulness, and development.

In this space, I'll be writing about:

- Experiences working on the Gelephu Mindfulness City project
- Insights from my research background in cognitive science
- Reflections on living and working in Bhutan
- Thoughts on technology, policy, and sustainable development
- Personal learnings and discoveries

Stay tuned for more posts coming soon!
