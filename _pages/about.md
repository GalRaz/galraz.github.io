Hi! This is Gal, I'm a 5th year PhD student at MIT working with [Prof. Rebecca Saxe](https://saxelab.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences](https://bcs.mit.edu/). I work on better understanding the computational mechanisms underlying visual attention, particularly in preverbal infants. To do this research, I use tools from developmental psychology, computational cognitive science and optimal decision theory. I also work on [automated tools for infant behavioral testing](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/k65yx) to make the study of the developing mind faster and more robust.

Before my PhD, I did my MSc in [Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/) and my BSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at [University College Utrecht](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/university-college-utrecht/about-ucu). 

After each degree program, I make a point of taking a gap year. So far, I spent this time as a visiting researcher at [Hitachi R&D in Japan](https://www.hitachi.com/rd/about/location/cer/index.html), volunteering at a [school in the north of India](https://lamdonjamyangschool.org/) and studying Vipassana meditation (as taught by [S.N. Goenka](https://www.dhamma.org/en-US/index)). Before that, I grew up in Germany, in two beautiful unversity towns, Münster and Göttingen.
